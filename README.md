Alvin Yap's Houdini HDA tools for Houdini 18.5

A selection of convenience tools I use in my personal work. 

SOP Context:
* FS Filecache: Simple file caching tool built around the filecache sop. Supports versioning as well as subframe export.
* FS Clusterbox: Creates a grid of boxes around an incoming object. Allows you to pick how many boxes in each axis. Useful for wedging multiple sims using tops.
* FS Depth From Camera: Creates Z Depth attribute
* FS Flow Vectors: Creates flow vectors
* FS Frustum: Creates very simple frustum geometry
* FS Frustum Grouper: Uses SDF of the frustum to quickly group geometry.
* FS Sand Dunes: SOP geometry to create sand-dune like terrain. 
* FS Project Curl Noise (BETA): Projects curl noise onto any geometry. Requires flow vectors.
